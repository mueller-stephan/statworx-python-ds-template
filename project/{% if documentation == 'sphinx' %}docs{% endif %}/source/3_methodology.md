# Methodology

This chapter explains which methods and algorithms are being used in the solution and why. Explain why certain models were used and others were not. If needed, include a short theoretical part about how the algorithm works. More importantly, showcase the business logic, the used features, and parameters, as well as their impact. Mention if there were more extensions or improvements planned but not realized.
